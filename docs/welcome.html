                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the SARIT website. Here you will find electronic editions of texts in
                        Sanskrit and other Indian languages. These are documented, dated and have embedded
                        notes about their change history, so that they can be publicly cited and used with
                        confidence as scholarly sources. The editions in the SARIT library currently include
                            <a href="./..">these works</a>.</p>
                    <p>This website also currently offers tools for text search, retrieval and analysis of
                        the works in the SARIT library. You can search for words and phrases, and have your
                        search results displayed as keywords-in-context. </p>
                    <p>All the texts at SARIT are licensed under a&#160;Creative Commons license.&#160;You
                        can download all the texts&#160;in the following formats: XML, EPUB and PDF; and you
                        can also open the XML-file online.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The <a href="http://www.tlg.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Thesaurus Linguae
                            Graecae</a> was founded in 1972. Its subsequent growth as a sophisticated
                        research tool, and the projects derived from it, such as <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" target="_blank">PERSEUS</a>,
                        demonstrated compellingly that a corpus of classical texts in machine-readable
                        format could be vitally important for the study of language, art, history and
                        culture. The history of SARIT looks back to a meeting convened by Prof. Richard
                        Lariviere at the University of Texas in 1988 that brought together many
                        specialists interested in creating a "TLG for Indic," i.e., a corpus of
                        machine-readable texts in Indian languages. The <a href="http://www.academia.edu/360194/Report_on_the_Sanskrit_Text_Archive_Conference_Austin_Texas_October_28-29_1988">minutes</a> of that meeting still make interesting reading today, and lay
                        out some of the rationales underlying the present project. After the Texas
                        meeting, the <a href="http://indology.info/" target="_blank">INDOLOGY
                            website</a> began to make electronic texts of Sanskrit works available in an
                        ad-hoc manner. This effort was highly successful, but there remained problems of
                        format normalization, non-standard fonts and character encodings. Many of these
                        problems were insoluble at the time. Things have moved forward since 1988,
                        especially in corpus linguistics, computer networking, and encoding standards.
                        SARIT takes advantage of all these new developments, especially <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_blank">XML</a> and the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>.
                                SARIT was initially developed during 2008 by Dominik Wujastyk and Richard Mahoney,
                                        and was <a href="http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2009-February/127206.html" target="_blank">announced 
                                        publicly in February 2009</a>.</p>

                    <h2>What makes SARIT different?</h2>
                    <p>The main difference between this collection of texts in Sanskrit and other Indian
                        languages is that these texts are marked up ("tagged") using the rich <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> system. TEI
                        is a way of tagging files that was designed by humanities scholars for
                        humanities scholars. It is capable of building a great deal of intelligence into
                        the file itself, so that a TEI-file can later serve many purposes and remains
                        flexible and useful in the long term. TEI files contain their own history, so
                        you can always find out where the file came from, how and when it has been
                        updated, and how it relates to printed editions, manuscripts or other sources.
                        For a gentle introduction to the TEI, see the excellent <a href="http://www.teibyexample.org/">TEI by Example website</a>. The files in
                        this language corpus can be considered as electronic editions, and can be cited
                        as such in scholarly research publications. SARIT texts respect copyright and
                        are licensed appropriately to allow free academic use. Furthermore, SARIT makes
                        its TEI editions of Indian texts freely available to all.</p>
                    <p>Electronic texts are not static: we edit them, improve them, alter them, and –
                        crucially – correct errors in them. SARIT solves the problem of how to manage
                        the natural evolution of electronic texts, documenting changes and allowing for
                        the divergence and comparison of versions, merging of versions and rolling-back
                        to previous versions. SARIT achieves this through the use of sophisticated
                        version-control software (see the technical section below). </p>
                    <!--NB! Works with "." Does not work with "?+*|{}[]()\" Single |()[] are removed from search term.-->
                    <!--<p>Additionally, any characters (except double quotes) are interpreted literally when surrounded by double quotes:</p> <pre class="literallayout">"john.smith.com"</pre>. NB: only works if shifting to phrase search. Partial phrase searches (john"@smith.com") are not possible-->

                    <h2>Technical description</h2>
                    <p>SARIT displays Indological texts marked up according to the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> guidelines.
                        The standardized TEI format used for encoding the files in the SARIT library
                        means that other interfaces and toolsets are possible and may be implemented in
                        future.</p>
                    <p>SARIT uses the Open Source XML database <a href="http://exist-db.org/" target="_blank">eXist-db</a> for search and display. The SARIT application
                        has been developed by the <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/hra-portal.html">HRA</a>
                         at the <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/">Cluster of Excellence 'Asia
                            and Europe in a Global Context'</a> (University of Heidelberg) in

                        history of all edits to the files is tracked. If you wish to report errors or
                        suggestions about the content of the SARIT text editions, for example errors in
